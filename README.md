                                                              	Overview

Whenever we go to shop something one of the things, we commonly do is make a list of items we intend to buy as it is common to forget something if we do not.
But an issue with paper lists is that they can be spoiled, torn or lost easily. Also, we need to carry pen to mark what is bought already. 
This is both cumbersome and a waste of resources.

                                                              	Purpose

This is a listing app that tries to resolve this problem. You can enter what you want to buy, in what quantity and its price.
It also computes the total price that item will cost.
This allows us to reduce clutter as we only need to carry out phone with us to have the list with us.

                                                          
                                                                APPLICATIONS

Right now, this solution can be applied to solve daily listing problem it maintains the grocery inventory.
